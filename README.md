### Summary

A small budgeting app as an alternative to Google sheet's annual budget planner.
The goal of the app is **not** to track individual expenses, work with multiple currencies at a time or anything related (if you're looking for something like this, check
out [firefly-iii](https://www.firefly-iii.org/)).
It should merely be used to roughly plan your budget across the year - a bit easier to use than google sheets and much simpler than more sophisicated apps such
as [firefly-iii](https://www.firefly-iii.org/).
